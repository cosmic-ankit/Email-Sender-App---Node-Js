# Email-Sender-App-Node-Js
this code creates a web page with a form that allows users to send an email message to a specified email address. When the user submits the form, the form data is sent to the server using an Ajax request. The server receives the data, uses the Nodemailer module to send an email message to the specified email address, and sends a response back to the client indicating whether the message was sent successfully or not.
